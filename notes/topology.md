Let $$X$$ be a set. A topology $$\tau$$ on $$X$$ is a collection of subsets
$$U \subseteq X$$ called *open sets*, such that:

- the empty set $$\emptyset$$ and $$X$$ are open sets
- the union of arbitrary many open sets is an open set
- the intersection of finitely many open sets is an open set

A set is *closed* if it is the complementary of some open set in
$$X$$, which immediately implies the following:

- $$\emptyset$$ and $$X$$ are both open and closed sets
- the intersection of arbitrary many closed sets is a closed set
- the union of finitely many closed sets is a closed set
