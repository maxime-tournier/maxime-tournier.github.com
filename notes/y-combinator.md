The $$Y$$ combinator makes it possible to define recursive function
using only anonymous functions. This note derives the $$Y$$ combinator
through the factorial function in the Scheme language, then presents
some comments adapted from various (excellent) sources.[^ayanonagon]

# Factorial Example 

```scheme
;; 0. start with our trusty factorial
(define (fact n)
  (if (= n 0) 1
      (* n (fact (- n 1))))))

(echo (fact 10))

;; 1. but what if we don't make use of named functions?
(define fact
  (lambda (n)
    (if (= n 0) 1
        (* n (????? (- n 1))))))

;; 2. ok let's say we pass ourselves as an extra argument "f" then:
(define fact
  (lambda (f n)
    (if (= n 0) 1
        (* n (f f (- n 1))))))

(echo (fact fact 10))

;; 3. and let's also curry the "f" parameter out while we're at it:
(define fact
  (lambda (f)
    (lambda (n)
      (if (= n 0) 1
          (* n ((f f) (- n 1)))))))

(echo ((fact fact) 10))

;; 4. then we name the self-application of "f" as "self":
(define fact
  (lambda (f)
    (let ((self (lambda (x) ((f f) x))))
      (lambda (n)
        (if (= n 0) 1
            (* n (self (- n 1))))))))

(echo ((fact fact) 10))

;; 5. transform the let into a lambda: pass "self" as an argument:
(define fact
  (lambda (f)
    ((lambda (self)
       (lambda (n)
         (if (= n 0) 1
             (* n (self (- n 1))))))
     (lambda (x) ((f f) x)))))

(echo ((fact fact) 10))

;; now, the inner lambda:
(lambda (self)
    (lambda (n)
      (if (= n 0) 1
          (* n (self (- n 1))))))
;; looks like a nice way of defining a recursive functions!

;; 6. let us now name "g" that nice lambda defining factorial the way
;; we like. when using this representation, the "self" parameter will be
;; replaced with the self-application function when called:
(define fact
  (lambda (f)
    (let ((g (lambda (self)
              (lambda (n)
                (if (= n 0) 1
                    (* n (self (- n 1))))))))
      (g (lambda (x) ((f f) x))))))

(echo ((fact fact) 10))

;; 7. again, replace that let with a lambda:
(define fact
  (lambda (f)
    ((lambda (g)
       (g (lambda (x) ((f f) x))))
     (lambda (self)
       (lambda (n)
         (if (= n 0) 1
             (* n (self (- n 1)))))))))

(echo ((fact fact) 10))

;; 8. now we don't want to be calling ourselves "(fact fact)" all the time, 
;; so we wrap that into a function that does it for us:
(define fact
  (lambda (x)
    (let ((res (lambda (f)
                ((lambda (g)
                   (g (lambda (x) ((f f) x))))
                 (lambda (self)
                   (lambda (n)
                     (if (= n 0) 1
                         (* n (self (- n 1))))))))))
      ((res res) x))))
      
(echo (fact 10))

;; 9. we name "omega" the self-application, and pass it "res":
(define fact
  (lambda (x)
    (let ((omega (lambda (f) (lambda (x) ((f f) x)))))
      ((omega 
        (lambda (f)
          ((lambda (g)
             (g (lambda (x) ((f f) x))))
           (lambda (self)
             (lambda (n)
               (if (= n 0) 1
                   (* n (self (- n 1)))))))))
       x))))
       
(echo (fact 10))

;; 10. let->lambda once more, this time on "omega":
(define fact
  (lambda (x)
    (((lambda (f) (lambda (x) ((f f) x))) 
      (lambda (f)
        ((lambda (g)
           (g (lambda (x) ((f f) x))))
         (lambda (self)
           (lambda (n)
             (if (= n 0) 1
                 (* n (self (- n 1)))))))))
     x)))
     
(echo (fact 10))

;; 11. now we isolate the nice definition of factorial, and pass it as a
;; parameter:
(define fact
  (lambda (self)
    (lambda (n)
      (if (= n 0) 1
          (* n (self (- n 1)))))))

;; 12. this is the Y-combinator in disguise!
(define Y
  (lambda (h)
    (lambda (x)
      (((lambda (f) (lambda (x) ((f f) x))) 
        (lambda (f)
          ((lambda (g)
             (g (lambda (x) ((f f) x))))
           h)))
       x))))

(echo ((Y fact) 10))

;; 13. simplify: (lambda (x) (f x)) is simply f:
(define Y
  (lambda (h)
    ((lambda (f) (lambda (x) ((f f) x))) 
     (lambda (f)
       ((lambda (g)
          (g (lambda (x) ((f f) x))))
        h)))))

(echo ((Y fact) 10))

;; 14. ((lambda (x) (f x)) y) is simply (f y) (here we substitute g for h to
;; get rid of the enclosing lambda):
(define Y
  (lambda (h)
    ((lambda (f) (lambda (x) ((f f) x))) 
     (lambda (f) (h (lambda (x) ((f f) x)))))))

(echo ((Y fact) 10))

;; 15. similarly, simplify self-application, and we're done!
(define Y
  (lambda (h)
    ((lambda (f) (f f))
     (lambda (f) (h (lambda (x) ((f f) x)))))))

(echo ((Y fact) 10))
```

# WTF?!

Ok, so what did we just do? We ended up wrapping recursive functions
into lambdas in order to access their own name:

```scheme
;; v1
(lambda (self) (lambda (args) ... (self...)))
```

This is nice and sweet, however we cannot use this definition directly in actual
computations, since we must self-apply our function to itself prior to calling
it:

```scheme
;; v2
(lambda (self) (lambda (args) ... ((self self)...)))
```

What we first did was to patch $$v_1$$ so that occurences of `self` in $$v_1$$
body are replaced with self-applications or the form `(self self)`. In other
words, the patched function is:

```scheme
(lambda (self) (v1 (self self)))
```

We used the $$\Omega$$ combinator, which self-applies a function to itself:

```scheme 
(define omega (lambda (f) (f f)))
```

And we obtained the second version $$v_2$$:

```scheme
(define v2 (lambda (self) (v1 (omega self)))
```

At this point, we patched every self-applications *inside* $$v_1$$'s body, but
we still need to self-apply ourselves at every *outer* call site:

```scheme
((v2 v2) 10)
```

To fix this, we ended up wrapping $$v_2$$ with self-application in order to
obtain something which behaves exactly like the recursive function *described*
by $$v_1$$:

```scheme
;; v3
(define fact (omega v2))

;; now we can use it as intended
(fact 10)
```

But really, what we just did by converting between $$v_1$$, $$v_2$$
and $$v_3$$ is exactly what the $$Y$$ combinator does:

```scheme
(define Y
  (lambda (v1)
    (omega (lambda (self) (v1 (omega self))))))
```

So this is what the $$Y$$ combinator is doing: it takes the nice
definition of a recursive function wrapped in a lambda (à la $$v_1$$),
plugs-in the self-applications required for actual concrete uses (à la
$$v_2$$), then adds an extra self-application so that we are left with
something convenient to work with, and which behaves exactly like the
recursive function we intended to define in the first place. And it
does so without ever naming a single function.

Given a function $$f$$, the $$Y$$ combinator *applies self-application
to the application of $$f$$ to self-application.*[^cannata] Now
hopefully this last sentence makes perfect sense.

# Evaluation Issues

But if we try and use the following definition for the $$Y$$
combinator:

```scheme
(define Y
  (lambda (h)
    (omega (lambda (f) (h (omega f))))))
```

then the program gets stuck in an infinite recursion! This is due to
the fact that Scheme uses call-by-value (*i.e.* evaluates the
arguments *before* the function call). By replacing $$\Omega$$:

```scheme
(lambda (f) (f f))
```

with: 

```scheme
(lambda (f) (lambda (x) ((f f) x)))
```

we add an extra layer of indirection that delays the evaluation of
```(f f)``` until we actually need it. If we don't do so, the
evaluation of ```(f f)``` triggers an infinite recursion and the
program eventually runs out of memory.

# Fixpoint

If we describe a recursive function by wrapping it in a lambda (à la
$$v_1$$):

```scheme
;; recursive function description
(define g (lambda (self) (lambda (args) ... (self...))))
```

Then the $$Y$$ combinator returns the function described by ```g```:

```scheme
;; Y computes the actual recursive function from its description
(define f (Y g))
```

In other words, ```f``` behaves exactly like the ```self``` parameter
 inside ```g```. So if we pass ```f``` as ```self``` in
```g```, we again obtain something that computes ```f```:

$$ f = g(f) $$

Replacing $$f$$ with its definition, we end up with:

$$ Y(g) = g\block{Y(g)} $$

In other words, $$Y(g)$$ is a fixpoint of $$g$$, for all $$g$$. $$Y$$
is called a *fixpoint combinator* since it computes a fixpoint of its
argument. If the argument happens to be a description of a recursive
function wrapped in a lambda (here ```g```), the fixpoint of the
description is the recursive function itself (here ```f```, which acts
like ```self```), which is what $$Y$$ returns.

# Typing

If we consider a recursive function description of the form:

```scheme
(define g (lambda (self) (lambda (args) ... (self...))))
```

Then ```g``` has the following type scheme as a (poly-)type:

$$ g: \forall \alpha, \alpha \to \alpha $$

From this, we can deduce that a fixpoint combinator has the following
type:

$$ \mathrm{fix}:  \forall \alpha, \block{\alpha \to \alpha} \to \alpha $$

This can be used for infering the type of recursive definitions in
let-bindings during Hindley-Milner type inference.
